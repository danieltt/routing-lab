Scripts for managing lxc for lab manager
Author: Daniel Turull <danieltt@kth.se>

This scripts rely on lxc containers

Add the following line to /etc/fstab
none /cgroup cgroup defaults 0 0

All the commands to be run as root.

NOTE: uncompress bifrost.tar first to create the file system
tar xvf bifrost.tgz

To create the envirorment use ./manage-topology create

Then for starting use ./manage-topoloy start

To see which containers are running use
lxc-ls

And to access to the terminal
lxc-console --name <name>

Type <Ctrl+a q> to exit the console
